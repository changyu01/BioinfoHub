## [GTEx: Genotype-Tissue Expression](https://gtexportal.org/home/)

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study **tissue-specific gene expression and regulation**. Samples were collected from **54 non-diseased tissue sites** across **nearly 1000 individuals**, primarily for molecular assays including **WGS**, **WES**, and **RNA-Seq**. Remaining samples are available from the GTEx Biobank. The GTEx Portal provides open access to data including gene expression, QTLs, and histology images.

We isolated twelve different types of human leukocytes from peripheral blood and bone marrow, treated them to induce activation and/or differentiation, and profiled their gene expression before and after treatment.  
The twelve cell types are:  
B cells, CD14+ cells, CD4+ CD45RO+ CD45RA- T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, IgG/IgA memory B cells, IgM memory B cells, Monocytes, NK cells, Neutrophils, Plasma cells from bone marrow, and Plasma cells from PBMC.
