--chemistry	(optional) Assay configuration. 
NOTE: by default the assay configuration is detected automatically, which is the recommended mode. 
You should only specify chemistry if there is an error in automatic detection. Select one of:

auto for auto-detection (default),
threeprime for Single Cell 3′,
fiveprime for Single Cell 5′,
SC3Pv1 for Single Cell 3′ v1,
SC3Pv2 for Single Cell 3′ v2,
SC3Pv3 for Single Cell 3′ v3,
SC5P-PE for Single Cell 5′ paired-end (both R1 and R2 are used for alignment),
SC5P-R2 for Single Cell 5′ R2-only (where only R2 is used for alignment).
